As a kind of microcosm of our global present moment, for example, on the island of Kauaʻi, reflected throughout Hawaiʻi Nei, and projected across the vast expanse of Oceania, some seem to not be willing to allow one another to exist in the most natural and basic ways of our ancestors; others seem to not be willing to allow the expression of human ingenuity to innovate and co-create technological tools that are as natural to human expression as gifts of wood-carving, weaving, farming, and building. Woodcarving, weaving , farming, and building are all technologies. From construction of our first simple shelters, humans have always innovated and created "unnatural" structures like simple homes, stone ovens, and fishing tools. Nature didn't create any of those things on her own, let alone the omnipresent weed-whipping tools of today. Nature expressed all these things into existence through everyday human beings like us, kānaka, because we too are co-creative creations of creation.



Could it be that all that we do as human beings, from agriculture to artificial intelligence, from seed banking to synthetic sentience, is part of the organic, natural expression of what it means to be human? Could we be vastly more multifaceted and multidimensional than previously imagined, much less understood?

​

Could it be that, instead of insisting that every square inch of this ancient paradise be developed and managed from a bygone 20th century industrial perspective, we can co-create responsive and adaptive methods of being in the world together, through continuous integration with humanity's most resilient, time-tested traditions of self-reliance and self-suffiency? Can we cultivate conscious awareness of our inextricable interdependence with an ecosystem that is as equally fragile as the miraculous balance that makes our own frail and ailing human bodies possible? Can we heal the outside by healing the inside, and vice versa?

​

We Don't Know What We Don't Know

​

Must every public decision be binary, either/or? Is there not any conceivable way beyond the seemingly intractable duality of the material realm, when it comes to responsible and compassionate stewardship of the fundamental natural resources of air, water, land, food, clothing, healthcare, and shelter that sustain human life? Is there really a hard line, across which, cooperation, peace, love, and understanding become impossible in the public domain?

​

If such an objective, empirical, obvious hard cold line of reality exists because that's just the way it is; can we please bring that line out like any other element of this hard cold reality world, and examine it? Measure it? Understand it through the lens of our objective scientific reasoning, so that we can all agree upon it?

​

No, of course we can't. Because such a line doesn't exist anywhere except within human minds, within our consciousness, which so far, still remains largely inexplicable to westen science, despite magnificent progress in mapping the neural networks that grow into human and animal brains, alike. These are among the reasons why more and more scientists of conscience have organically grown new communities such as Science and Nonduality, as a  reasoned and responsible response to the present moment, ten years after the completion of the Standard Model of physics. 

​

"The mission of Science and Nonduality (SAND) is to forge a new paradigm in spirituality, one that is not dictated by religious dogma, but that is rather based on timeless wisdom traditions of the world, informed by cutting-edge science, and grounded in direct experience."

​
What does it mean, in the present moment, to cultivate conditions on Earth as it is in Heaven? If, as so many of us were taught, this is our most fundamental and fervent prayer, pule, petition, and shared aspiration, are we not compelled to ask ourselves whether the choices we make today are directly or indirectly advancing or obstructing that mission? Are there only two choices available to us in contemplating this mission, as some seem to advocate? To heedlessly race forward into a 22nd century techno-dystopia or to hedonically race back to a harder than hard-scrabble might-makes-right 2nd century?

​

Amidst such conceptually and materially divergent adjacent realities, perhaps one of the most profound and paradoxical serendipities of the present moment is the fact that the scientific enterprise itself, to the extent that it has been co-dependent upon the Standard Model of physics as evidence of its efficacy in the world; is now at a cross-roads, "completely" explaining less than 5% of material reality. For the past decade, the Observer Effect remains as irrefutable as it is inscrutable.

​

It may be one of history's greatest marvels that, during this seemingly disruptive span of time, an entirely new kind of open, interactive, cooperative, interdisciplinary, citizen science has emerged; continously integrating alongside of a philosophical, psychological, scientific, and spiritual vangard that burgeons and blossoms with new Theories of Everything that suggest that matter itself, everything that we took for granted as "real," is actually, empirically, emergent from consciousness, rather than old  20th century assumptions that consciouness magically arises from the material substrate of brain tissue.

​

These are just a few of the scintillating facets of reflected light and direct experience shining forth in the present moment, right here on this Pale Blue Dot, right now on this Garden Island Earth.

Cultivating Clarity in Everyday Life

​

What can and ought we do in response to such simultaneously expansive and disruptive change? Changes that seems to have landed the bottom rail on top, and tipped over so may social, scientific, political, and religious sacred cows?

​

Short Term Suggestion: Cultivate compassion for ourselves, our environment, our fragile global civilization. The more rapid and unpredictable the change, the slower, more contemplative, and measured our response. For example, right here in our own back yard, Clarifying Consciousness is an opportunity to hold space for an increasingly Compassionate Kauaʻi County, Hawaiʻi Nei, and Island Earth.
